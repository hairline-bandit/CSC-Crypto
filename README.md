# CSC-Crypto
I have **not** tested this thorougly, that being said I think it works in its entirety now.

(CSC stands for "Completely Sucky Cryptocurrency", yes the "Crypto" afterwards is redundant).

It is centralized because I have absolutely no clue how to make a P2P network.

If you are cloning make sure to move the files from "text_databases" to "src" so that Python can access them

It is now hosted somewhere
